# gæmstone Game Engine

The **gæmstone** project, pronounced /ɡɛmstoʊn/ (like "gem" but with the hard G from "game"), is a 3D game engine written in C# and targeting cross-platform .NET Core, making heavy use of [Entity Component System](ECS) (ECS) design. It is meant to become the foundation for my [own games](gaemdesign). Core features, which have yet to be written, include:

- Incredibly modular due to ECS design
- In-game entity and component editor
- Modify and add assets and similar at runtime
- Hot reloading of code (systems) at runtime
- Multiplayer support, probably server-client
- Library for "Bloxel" game support
- Support for different graphical back-ends
